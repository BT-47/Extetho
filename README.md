# Extetho+

***[NOTICE!]:*** *Development on Extetho is currently under hiatus indefinitely until further notice.*

Modified and (very much) extended version of Etho's Modded Season 2 modpack formerly for Minecraft Forge 1.16.5 (Extetho Classic) and now updated for 1.19.2, specifically designed for Private Use. *Check the [FAQ](https://github.com/BT-47/Extetho/wiki/FAQ)!*

Extetho is a combination of [Ethos Modded Season 2 modpack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/ethos-modded-s2), [Better Adventures+](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/better-adventures-plus), and [Atlas](https://github.com/MeepishRealms/Atlas). Extetho is provided as-is and the developer will not be responsible for any crashes, file corruption, or copyright as a result of using Extetho.

Source code copies of Extetho contain no mod files and are packaged as Modrinth modpacks which can be opened using a variety of launchers such as Prism Launcher.
